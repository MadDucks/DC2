# DC2 Stacker

The Kickstarter backers that have bought the DC2 (a stack of 4 containers) might have a hard time to get them stacked.
This is because there's no lock to get the containers nicely stacked. To make sure they keep "stacked" on top of each other I created a small frame called the "DC2 Stacker" :-)

All you need to do is print (a 3D printer that is, not you're regular printer) the STL file three times, one fill be a base layer and the two other layers should glued together with superglue.

The end result should look like this;

## The two layers are glued together, and should be placed on top of the fist two containers

## The next layer of containers should fit in nicely

## The end result, now the containers won't fall off the stack
